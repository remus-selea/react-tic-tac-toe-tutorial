# React Tic Tac Toe Tutorial

Decided to follow the [official react tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) just for fun.

I have also completed all the extra improvements listed at the bottom:
- ✔️ Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- ✔️ Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
- ✔️ Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- ✔️ Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- ✔️ When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- ✔️ When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
